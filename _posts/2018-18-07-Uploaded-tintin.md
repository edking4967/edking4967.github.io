Hey, internet! 

I just uploaded Tintin, a set of tools to help incorporate geographical data into games. Currently, it exits in two parts: an environment simulator and an elevation data generator, primarily for Unity. 

If this sounds interesting, [check it out](http://github.com/edking4967/tintin/) and clone it!

```bash
git clone http://github.com/edking4967/tintin/
```
